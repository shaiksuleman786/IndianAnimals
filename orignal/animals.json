    "description": "The American Crow is a large, all-black bird known for its intelligence, adaptability, and strong social behavior. With a distinctive cawing call, these birds are highly vocal and can often be seen in large flocks. They thrive in a variety of habitats, from forests and farmlands to cities and suburban areas. American Crows are omnivorous and opportunistic, feeding on everything from insects and grains to small animals and human leftovers. Their cleverness is unmatched among birds, as they can solve problems, recognize faces, and even use tools.",
